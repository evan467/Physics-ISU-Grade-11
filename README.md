This was an assignment I did in high school for my grade 11 physics class. It features two games and a loading screen animation. This was made with Turing code as it was the first language I learned.
The games are hoop dreams and a basic space physics game.
In hoop dreams you are tasked with making a charged ball hit another ball using some electromagnetic physics to aid you. 
In the space ship simulator you are tasked with reaching a point on the far end of the screen by ejecting fuel. There are obstacles such as asteroids that combine mass and stars that pull you in!
If you plan on playing this game you can download the Turing compiler and just run the code, please read all instructions!
Cheers,
